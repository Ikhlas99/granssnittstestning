Feature:Add choices
  As a user I'm interesting to add choices to my account
  to keep track of what I want to watch

  Scenario:
    Given that I'm at the search page
    And they are clickable menus at the menu
    When I click the 'Top Rated Movies'
    Then I see a list of 'movies'
    And I click on the favorite movie 'Nyckeln till frihet'
    And I should be able to add the item to my watchlist
